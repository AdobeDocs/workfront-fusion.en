# Approve or disapprove templates for the Public tab

Adobe Workfront Fusion templates are pre-built scenarios designed to automate and streamline various workflows. These templates can help users quickly set up integrations and automations without needing to build everything from scratch.

If you are an administrator, you can choose whether or not certain templates should be shared with the entire organization on the Public templates tab. 

Users can send templates they create for approval to be shared on the Public templates page. <!--do the have to be requested or can an admin just choose to approve?-->

## Approve or disapprove [!DNL Workfront Fusion] templates

Approving a template makes it visible in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab and available to all users. 

Disapproving a template removes it from the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab and makes it available only to the team that created it.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** in the left navigation panel to open the [!UICONTROL Administration] area.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Templates]** in the left navigation panel.
1. If you want to approve a template, click **[!UICONTROL Approve]** to the right of the template.
1. If you want to disapprove a template, click **[!UICONTROL Disapprove]** to the right of the template.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are approving the template that was previously approved and then edited, your second approval will overwrite the original template.


## Template statuses

You can check the status on the template page under the template name.

The following statuses are available:

* **[!UICONTROL Private]**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team.
* **[!UICONTROL Published]**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team. Once published, you can send the template for approval if desired. You can also copy a shareable link.
* **[!UICONTROL Approved]**: This template is visible for all Workfront Fusion users in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab. You can also copy a shareable link by clicking [!UICONTROL Options] in the upper-right corner of the screen.

You can also check the status from the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab. If a template is published, it will have an icon to the right of the template name.

* **Eye icon**: The template is published; it is visible only for the team; and an approval request was not sent.
* **Yellow checkmark icon**: The template is published; it is visible only for the team; and it is pending approval to be added to the Public templates tab.
* **Green checkmark icon**: The template is available in the Public templates tab and is visible for any Workfront Fusion user. It is also still visible in the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab. The template author or their team member can still edit it.

Templates without icons have [!UICONTROL Private] status. They are not published and are visible only to the team.




## Questions about how this works

Editing

1. If an admin edits a template, do they have to publish again? ... Do they have to approve again?
1. What does publishing actually do?
1. Does a user have to submit for approval to share on the Public tab or can admin go through and approve/reject which ones they want? 
1. What is the admin approving? Does a user have to submit it for approval?
