# Approve or disapprove templates for the Public tab

Adobe Workfront Fusion templates are pre-built scenarios designed to automate and streamline various workflows. These templates can help users quickly set up integrations and automations without needing to build everything from scratch.

If you are an administrator, you can choose whether or not certain templates should be shared with the entire organization on the Public templates tab. 

Users can send templates they create for approval to be shared on the Public templates page. <!--do the have to be requested or can an admin just choose to approve?-->
