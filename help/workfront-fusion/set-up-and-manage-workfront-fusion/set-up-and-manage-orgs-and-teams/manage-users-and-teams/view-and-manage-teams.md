# View and manage teams

Teams are groups of users that share access to specific resources. These resources may include:

* Scenarios
* Connections
* Webhooks
* Keys
* Data stores
* Data structures
* Email notification settings

You can view a list of your organization's teams, and edit the names of the teams.

To add users to teams, see [Add a user to a team](/help/workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-orgs-and-teams/set-up-orgs-teams-and-users/add-a-user-to-a-team.md).
