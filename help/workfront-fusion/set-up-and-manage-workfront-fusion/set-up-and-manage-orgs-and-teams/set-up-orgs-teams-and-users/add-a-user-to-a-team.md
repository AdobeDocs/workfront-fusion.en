## Add a user

Adding a user to a team is handled from the page for that team.

1. Go to the team you want to add the user to by selecting **Org overview** in the left panel, clicking the **Teams** tab on the organization page, and selecting the team.

   Or

   If you are on the page for another team, click the team dropdown at the top of the page.

1. On the Team's page (with the team name at the top of the page), select the **Users** tab.
1. Locate the user on the page. Users in your organization appear on this page even if they are not a member of the team.
1. Click **None** to the right of the user's name, then select the role you want them to have on the team.

    The user is added to the team, with the role you selected.
