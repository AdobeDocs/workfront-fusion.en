# Create a team

<!--Affected by IMS-->

Teams are smaller groups within the organization, and share Fusion resources such as scenarios, connections, and templates. You can create as many teams as you want.

Organizations may have as many teams as they need, and users may belong to one or more teams.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because teams share resources, it is sometimes useful for a team to have only one member. For example, users in training may create connections to their individual [!DNL Workfront] accounts. Any team members would also be able to connect to the individual [!DNL Workfront] account. In this case we recommend that the user be the only member of a training team.
