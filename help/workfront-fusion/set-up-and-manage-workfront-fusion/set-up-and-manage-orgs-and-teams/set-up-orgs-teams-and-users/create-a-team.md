# Create a team

Teams are smaller groups within the organization, and share Fusion resources such as scenarios, connections, and templates. You can create as many teams as you want.

Organizations may have as many teams as they need, and users may belong to one or more teams.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because teams share resources, it is sometimes useful for a team to have only one member. For example, users in training may create connections to their individual Workfront accounts. Any team members would also be able to connect to the individual Workfront account. In this case we recommend that the user be the only member of a training team.
