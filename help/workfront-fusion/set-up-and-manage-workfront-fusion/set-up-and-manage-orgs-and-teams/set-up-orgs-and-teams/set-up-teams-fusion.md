# Create a team

<!--Affected by IMS-->

Teams are smaller groups within the organization, and share Fusion resources such as scenarios, connections, and templates. You can create as many teams as you want.

Organizations may have as many teams as they need, and users may belong to one or more teams.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because teams share resources, it is sometimes useful for a team to have only one member. For example, users in training may create connections to their individual [!DNL Workfront] accounts. Any team members would also be able to connect to the individual [!DNL Workfront] account. In this case we recommend that the user be the only member of a training team.

## Create a team 

Organization owners and administrators are able to create teams. Teams are created by adding a new team to an organization.

To create a team:

1. In the left navigation panel, click **[!UICONTROL Org overview]**
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Teams]** tab.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add a new team]**. 
   ![Create a team](assets/create-new-team-button.png)
1. Enter a name for the new team, and click **Add**.

#### Switch between teams

You may be part of more than one team in Fusion. Since teams do not share resources, you may need to switch teams to access specific scenarios or other resources.

If your organization is not on the Adobe Unified Experience, you can switch teams by clicking the team name in the left navigation, then selecting a team from the dropdown.

If your team is on the Adobe Unified Experience, you can select a new team by clicking on the team name in the header, then selecting a team from the dropdown. This option is available from all pages that are specific to a certain team, such as a scenario page or the Connections page.
