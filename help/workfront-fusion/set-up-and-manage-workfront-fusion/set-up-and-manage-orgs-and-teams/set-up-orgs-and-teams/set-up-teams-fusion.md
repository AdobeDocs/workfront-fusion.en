#### Switch between teams

You may be part of more than one team in Fusion. Since teams do not share resources, you may need to switch teams to access specific scenarios or other resources.

If your organization is not on the Adobe Unified Experience, you can switch teams by clicking the team name in the left navigation, then selecting a team from the dropdown.

If your team is on the Adobe Unified Experience, you can select a new team by clicking on the team name in the header, then selecting a team from the dropdown. This option is available from all pages that are specific to a certain team, such as a scenario page or the Connections page.
