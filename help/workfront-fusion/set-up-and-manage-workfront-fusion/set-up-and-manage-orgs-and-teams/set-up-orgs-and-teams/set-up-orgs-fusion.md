### Inviting users to an organization

By default, an organization owner (or authorized user) can invite another person to join their organization.

To invite a user to join an organization:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Change details]** in the upper-right corner of the screen.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Invite a new user]**.

1. Fill in the user's email address and name.
1. Select a role for the user. For more information on roles, see [Organization roles](#organization-roles) in this document.
1. (Optional) Add a note. This note appears in the invitation email that the user receives.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

[!DNL Fusion] sends an email with an invitation to the specific organization and an [!UICONTROL Accept The Role] button.

When the recipient clicks the button, they are redirected to the invitation page, where they can accept the invitation.

The invitation will expire in a day.

>[!NOTE]

>If the user is new to [!DNL Fusion], [!DNL Fusion] automatically creates an account for them and sends an email with a temporary password, directing the new user to log in and change their password.

### Switch between organizations

You may be part of more than one organization in Fusion. Resources are not shared between organizations.

You can switch organizations within the Adobe Unified Experience by clicking the organization name in the upper-right corner and selecting the new organization from the dropdown. Only organizations that have a Fusion account will appear in the dropdown, even if you are a member of other organizations in Adobe.
