# Access requirements in documentation

Adobe Workfront Fusion documentation how-to articles contain a table that explains the access and permissions requirements needed for that procedure. This Access requirements table allows you to understand whether you can perform a certain action in Fusion, or why you might not be able to. This article explains each element of the Access requirements table, and provides troubleshooting tips and links to more in-depth information.

If a row is absent from the Access requirements table in a given article, there are no requirements of that type for that action.

Some rows contain information labeled "New" and "Current." This is because Workfront is transitioning to a new pricing and packaging model, with some organizations operating under the new model and others still using the current model. To find out which model your organization uses, contact your Workfront administrator. You can find details and links to information in the [The Access requirements table](#the-access-requirements-table) section of this article. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you have questions about how any of the fields in this table apply to you, contact your Workfront administrator.

<table style="table-layout:auto"> 
 <col> 
 <col> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront package 
   <td> Adobe Workfront packages refer to the set of features that your organization has purchased. Most Fusion functionality is available in all plans, but there are some exceptions that are only available to organizations with an Ultimate Workfront package. 
   <ul><li>To find out what Adobe Workfront package your organization uses, including whether your organization is under the new or current packaging model, contact your Workfront administrator.</li>

   <td>In some cases, Fusion must be purchased in addition to Workfront. If your organization has the Ultimate Workfront package, Fusion is included.
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Access level</td> 
   <td> Access levels are sets of permissions for actions you can perform in Fusion. For example, some actions can only be perfomed by a Fusion Administrator. 
  <tr> 
   <td role="rowheader">Adobe Workfront Fusion license</td> 
   <td>Adobe Workfront Fusion has a separate licensing model than Workfront. 
   <ul><li>Current: The current license model is based on the number of operations performed, and has no limitations on what actions an organization can perform. </li>
   <li>Legacy: Legacy licenses are based on whether scenarios are able to connect to third-party applications, or whether the scenarios are used for Workfront automation only. </li>
   </ul>
