# Worker pools

A worker pool is a quantity of Workfront Fusion processing resources dedicated to one or more specific organizations. All Fusion operations and processing happen within the context of an organization's assigned worker pool.

Worker pools allow your scenarios to run more efficiently, and reduce or eliminate the chances of competing with other organizations for Fusion processing capacity.
