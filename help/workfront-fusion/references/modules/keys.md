# Keys

Public and private keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key can be distributed, and anyone with the public key can encrypt data, but only the private key can decrypt it. Similarly, a user with a private key can encrypt data that anyone with the public key can decrypt. In the Keys area, you can view and manage keys that your team owns.

## Using keys in Workfront Fusion

Similar to connections, keys are added to invidual modules, and are then available for use in other modules. 

1. In a module that requires a key, in the Key field, select an existing key from the dropdown menu.

   Or

   Click **Add** next to the key field, then enter a name for the key and the key itself, then click **Create a key**. 

To view existing keys, click the **Keys** area in the left navigation.
