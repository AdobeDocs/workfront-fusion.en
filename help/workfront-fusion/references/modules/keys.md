# Keys

Public and private keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key can be distributed, and anyone with the public key can encrypt data, but only the private key can decrypt it. Similarly, a user with a private key can encrypt data that anyone with the public key can decrypt. In the Keys area, you can view and manage keys that your team owns.

## Create a key

Similar to connections, keys are added to individual modules, and are then available for use in other modules. 

1. In a module that requires a key, in the Key field, select an existing key from the dropdown menu.

   Or

   Click **Add** next to the key field, then enter a name for the key and the key itself, then click **Create a key**. 

To view existing keys, click the **Keys** area in the left navigation.

## Update a key

You can update an existing key. When the key is updated, all scenarios that use the key will use the updated key.

1. In Fusion, click Keys ![Keys icon](assets/keys-icon.png) in the left navigation. 
1. Select the key that you want to edit, then click Edit in the bar at the bottom of the screen.
