## Tips for finding content in Experience League

Searching documentation can be more efficient with a few strategic approaches. Here are some tips to help you find what you need effectively:

### Use the Table of Contents and Search bar 

* **Table of Contents**: Start with the table of contents on the left of the page to get an overview of available topics and narrow down to specific topics by the expanding sections.
* **Search bar**: Use the search bar near the top of the page to find documentation. Enter specific terms related to your issue or topic. Instead of general terms like "scenario," use "add a filter" or "Workfront connector."

### Explore Learning and Training Sections

* **Live instructor-led training sessions** Adobe offers live three-day training sessions for Fusion. See [Manage Connections and Workflows in Adobe Workfront Fusion](https://learning.adobe.com/courses/adobe_workfront/cours000000000098121.html) for details and available sessions.
* **Training Materials**: Navigate to the [Introduction and tech strategy](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-learn/tutorials-workfront/fusion/welcome-to-workfront-fusion/introduction-and-tech-strategy) Workfront Fusion training page to begin a series of lessons and exercises designed to help you better understand how to best use Fusion.

### Find answers in Community Forums

* **Ask Questions**: If the documentation doesn't answer your question, try posting in the [Workfront Fusion Community forums](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/workfront-fusion/ct-p/workfront-fusion-2) where other users and experts can offer assistance.
