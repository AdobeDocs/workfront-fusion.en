# View, edit, and delete templates

[!DNL Workfront Fusion] templates feature allows you to create and use existing templates as a starting point for your Workfront Fusion scenarios. Templates represent common use cases that you can configure and modify to meet the needs of your organization and specific use case.

For a list of currently available Fusion templates, see [Currently available Adobe Workfront Fusion templates](/help/workfront-fusion/create-and-manage-templates/currently-available-fusion-templates.md).

>* If you cannot find the public template that has been created by you, contact the administrator. It is possible that before approving your template, the administrator had renamed it.

## Edit a template

You can edit any templates that are available in the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Templates]** icon ![](assets/fusion-template-icon.png) in the side navigation menu.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Team templates]** tab.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Private]** tab.
1. Click the template you want to edit.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the top-right corner

   or

   Click the template diagram.

1. Make changes in the template. You can access all options that were available when creating the template. To see these options, see [Create new templates](/help/workfront-fusion/create-and-manage-templates/create-new-fusion-templates.md).
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Save]** icon ![](assets/save-icon.png).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab includes not only the published templates, but also copies of the templates that were already made public by the administrator. This means you can edit a template that is already visible to everyone. If you modify one of these templates, your changes do not overwrite the public template right away. The template in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab is still untouched and stays public, but its newer version with your changes from the [!UICONTROL Team templates] begins the publishing process. When the modified version is published and approved, it overwrites the original public template.

## Delete a template

You can only delete templates that are not yet approved. If you want to delete a public template, contact your administrator.

Please note that after you delete a template, it cannot be restored. Team templates are available for all members of your team, so before deleting a template we recommend that you check with your teams to ensure that the template is not needed.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Templates]** icon ![](assets/templates-icon.png) in the side navigation menu.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Team templates]** tab.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete]** next to the template name

   Or

   Click the name of the template to go into the template. Click **[!UICONTROL Options]** in the top right corner and select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Really?]** to confirm the delete.
