   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* After the template is approved, it becomes public. [!UICONTROL Public templates] are visible in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab for all Workfront Fusion users, regardless of the organization or the team.
   >* Your administrator is not notified about receiving the template to review by email. If the approval is urgent, contact the administrator directly.


## Template statuses

Fusion saves the different versions (Private, Published, and Approved) in different tabs of the template's page.

The following statuses are available:

* **[!UICONTROL Private]**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team.
* **[!UICONTROL Published]**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team. You can send published templates for approval and copy a shareable link.
* **[!UICONTROL Approved]**: This template is visible for all Workfront Fusion users in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab. You can copy a shareable link by clicking [!UICONTROL Options] in the upper-right corner of the screen.

<!--You can also check the status from the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab. If a template is published, it will have an icon to the right of the template name.

* **Eye icon**: The template is published, it is visible only for the team, and the approval request was not sent.
* **Yellow checkmark icon**: The template is published, it is visible only for the team, and the approval request was sent.
* **Green checkmark icon**: The template is published and public. It is visible for any Workfront Fusion user in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab. It is also still visible in the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab, and the template author or their team member can still edit it.

Templates without icons have [!UICONTROL Private] status. They are not published and are visible only to the team.
