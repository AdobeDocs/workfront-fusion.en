# Publish and share templates

When you create a template, your template becomes available for all your team members. If you want to share the template with someone outside of your team, you must publish it first.

For information on creating a template, see [Create a new template](/help/workfront-fusion/create-and-manage-templates/create-new-fusion-templates.md).

## Template statuses

Fusion saves the different versions (Private, Published, and Approved) in different tabs of the template's page.

The following statuses are available:

* **[!UICONTROL Private]**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team.
* **[!UICONTROL Published]**: This template is visible only for the template author and their team. You can send published templates for approval and copy a shareable link.
* **[!UICONTROL Approved]**: This template is visible for all Workfront Fusion users in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab. You can copy a shareable link by clicking [!UICONTROL Options] in the upper-right corner of the screen.

<!--You can also check the status from the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab. If a template is published, it will have an icon to the right of the template name.

* **Eye icon**: The template is published, it is visible only for the team, and the approval request was not sent.
* **Yellow checkmark icon**: The template is published, it is visible only for the team, and the approval request was sent.
* **Green checkmark icon**: The template is published and public. It is visible for any Workfront Fusion user in the [!UICONTROL Public templates] tab. It is also still visible in the [!UICONTROL Team templates] tab, and the template author or their team member can still edit it.

Templates without icons have [!UICONTROL Private] status. They are not published and are visible only to the team.
