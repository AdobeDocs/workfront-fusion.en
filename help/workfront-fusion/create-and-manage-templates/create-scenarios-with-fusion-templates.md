## Prerequisites

You must create a template before you can use it.

## Create a scenario from a template

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Templates]** icon ![Templates icon](assets/templates-icon.png) in the left navigation panel.
1. Click the tab that contains the template you want to use (Public templates or Team templates).
1. Click the template you want to use to start creating a scenario. You can use the search box in the upper-right corner to find the template by its name or the name of the app included in it.
1. (Conditional) If you are a member of more than one organization or team, select which organization or team you want to create your scenario for and click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.
1. (Conditional) If the template was configured with [!UICONTROL Wizard], follow the prompts to configure the scenario. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** on each prompt to confirm it.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the **[!UICONTROL Use as default value]** option was checked during the template setup, some of the fields may be prefilled for you.

1. When you have configured all the settings required for the template, you receive a notification that your template is ready to go, and the standard scenario options appear at the bottom of the screen. You can now continue building your scenario.

   For information on building a scenario, see [orkflow for creating a scenario](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/plan-a-scenario/create-a-scenario-workflow.md).

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Save]** icon ![Save icon](assets/save-icon.png) to save your scenario. The scenario saves to the Scenario area of Workfront Fusion.
