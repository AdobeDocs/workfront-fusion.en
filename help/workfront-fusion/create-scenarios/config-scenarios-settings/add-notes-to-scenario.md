# Add notes to a scenario

We recommend the optional but useful practice of adding notes to your scenario. Notes are attached to individual modules, and are displayed in the scenario editor. You can toggle notes on and off, and can add multiple notes to a module.

1. Right-click a Workfront module, then click **[!UICONTROL Add a note]**.
1. In the note that appears, click the Edit icon ![Edit icon](assets/edit-note.png).
1. Enter the text of your note.
1. Click **Done** to save the note.
1. Drag the note to the desired location on the Scenario editor.

     After you add a note to a scenario, a blue dot displays on the **[!UICONTROL Notes]** icon ![Notes icon with dot](assets/notes-icon-w-dot.png) at the bottom of the scenario editor.

1. To view or hide all notes, click the **[!UICONTROL Notes]** icon ![Notes icon with dot](assets/notes-icon-w-dot.png).
