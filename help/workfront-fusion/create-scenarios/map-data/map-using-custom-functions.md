# Map data using custom functions


You can create custom functions in the Functions area of Fusion. You then add these functions to your scenarios in the form of an Adobe App Builder module.

Because custom functions work through Adobe App Builder, your organization must have an Adobe App Builder license to use them.

Workfront Fusion also includes built-in functions that allow you to create simple or complex formulas. These functions cover a wide variety of use cases, including functions for arrays, strings, numbers, and data from previous modules.

For information and instructions on built-in functions, see [Map an item using built-in functions](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/map-data/map-using-functions.md).
