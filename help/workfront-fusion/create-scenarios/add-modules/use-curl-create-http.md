## Create an HTTP module from a cURL request


To create an HTTP module using cURL:

1. Create the text of the cURL request outside of Fusion, such as in a text editor.
1. Copy the cURL request to your clipboard.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Scenarios]** tab in the left panel.
1. Select the scenario where you want to create the module.
1. Click anywhere on the scenario to enter the Scenario editor.
1. Right click on any white space in the scenario editor and select **Paste**.

   Or

   Press Ctrl + V (Windows) or Cmd + V (Mac).
   

   An HTML module is created.
1. Drag the module to connect it to your scenario.

## Troubleshooting

If your cURL is not pasting into your scenario, check your browser settings to ensure that pasting from the clipboard is enabled.
