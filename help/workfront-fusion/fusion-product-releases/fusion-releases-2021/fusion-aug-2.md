## New functions available in mapping panel

Two new functions are now available in the mapping panel.

* New date and time function: dateDifference

  To make it easier to calculate spans of time in your scenarios, we've added the new "dateDifference" date and time function. This function takes two dates or times and a unit of time, and returns the amount of time between the dates or times, expressed in the chosen unit of time.

  Previously, date and time difference could be calculated only by a formula entered by the user.

* New array function: arrayDifference

  This function takes two arrays, and returns a new array. You can select the type of new array that the module returns:

   * An array of elements of one array that aren't contained in the other
   * An array of elements that are contained in one array or the other, but not both.
