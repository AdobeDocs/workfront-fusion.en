# Workfront Fusion release activity:&nbsp;Week of October 4, 2021

This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of October 4, 2021.

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](/help/workfront-fusion/fusion-product-releases/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## See existing event filters in Workfront > Watch Events modules

For increased clarity, we've made it possible to see the event filters used by a webhook in a given Workfront > Watch events module. Now, when you click into a Workfront > Watch event module, the event filters for that webhiook are listed out, allowing you to see at a glance which events can trigger the module.

Previously, users could only see event filters when setting up the webhook, and there was no way to view the filters in an existing Workfront > Watch Events module.

## Attach custom forms to Workfront objects using the Workfront > Create record and Update record modules

To make the use of custom forms more similar to the experience in Workfront, we've made it possible to add custom forms to Workfront objects. Now, you can select a custom form when creating or updating an object. The custom form's fields then open for you to enter values.

Previously, you could enter values into fields on custom forms, but they were not organized by form and could be difficult to find.


## Use rich text in comments and custom fields created by Workfront Fusion

Now, you can use rich text when you use the Workfront > Create a record or Update a record modules in Workfront Fusion. Add HTML tags to the text of the comment or custom field you are adding or updating, and the comment in Workfront displays the formatting. This functionality also applies to replies to comments.

Updates support the following rich text formats:

* Bold
* Italic
* Underline
* Bullet List
* Number List
* Link
* Blockquote
* Break Line

Previously, rich text could only be added to comments or custom fields through Workfront itself or the Workfront API.
