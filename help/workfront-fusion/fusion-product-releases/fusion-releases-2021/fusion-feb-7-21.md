This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of February 7, 2022.

For a list of all recent changes, see [Adobe Workfront Fusion release activity](/help/workfront-fusion/fusion-product-releases/fusion-release-activity.md).

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates.html) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## Anaplan connector and modules now available

Now you can use Adobe Workfront Fusion to connect to your Anaplan account. With the Anaplan modules, you can

* Create, read, update, delete, or search Anaplan records
* Batch import records to Anaplan

## Go directly to the Scenario Editor when creating a scenario

To make the scenario creation process smoother, we've removed the app selection page. Now, you can go directly to the Scenario Editor and select the app you want to connect to from the list that appears when you add a module.

Previously, you could select apps from the app selection page as well as the list.
