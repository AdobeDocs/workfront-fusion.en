## New look and feel for Adobe Workfront Fusion

We've updated the look and feel of Workfront Fusion to more closely reflect the look and feel of other Adobe products. This change to the cleaner look allows a more consistent experience when working across various Adobe products.

This upgrade also offers performance improvements for faster navigation.

The new look and feel does not affect the functionality of Adobe Workfront Fusion. All buttons, tabs, and other tools are in the same location, so you don't need to change any of your existing behaviors or workflows.
