## Server-to-server connection now available for Workfront Planning connector

We've added the option to create server-to-server connections for your Workfront Planning modules. 

If you already have server-to-server credentials configured for a Workfront connection, you can use those same credentials for a Workfront Planning connection.

For information on the Workfront Planning connector, including how to configure a server-to-server connection, see [Workfront Planning modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/workfront-planning-modules.md).
