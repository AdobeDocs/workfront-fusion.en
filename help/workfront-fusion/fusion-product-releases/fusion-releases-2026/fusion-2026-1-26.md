## Workfront Fusion API now available

To allow you to programatically interact with Fusion to build, manage, and operate automations at scale, we've released the Workfront Fusion APIs. Now, you can use the APIs to perform many of the same actions available in the Fusion user interface.

The APIs are being released incrementally and are currently marked as experimental. The Fusion team is actively developing and expanding the API surface, and updates will be published as new functionality becomes available.

For more information and documentation about the Workfront Fusion API see [Workfront Fusion API](https://developer.adobe.com/workfront-fusion-apis/).
