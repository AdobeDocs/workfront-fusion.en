## View organization-wide performance metrics on the Fusion Performance Dashboard

To make it easier to understand Fusion performance across your organization, we've created the new Performance Dashboard. Now, Fusion administrators can quickly see which scenarios are running the most, where delays are occurring, and how effectively worker pools are operating. The Performance Dashboard provides real-time visibility into execution volumes, queue depth, pool utilization, and scenario-level performance.

For information about the Fusion Performance Dashboard, see [View the performance dashboard for an organization](/help/workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-orgs-and-teams/set-up-orgs-teams-and-users/view-performance-dashboard.md).
