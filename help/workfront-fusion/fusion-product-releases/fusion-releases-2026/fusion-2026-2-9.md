## New Microsoft SharePoint Online > Create a file module

We're added a new Create a file module to the Microsoft SharePoint Online connector. The new module offers better performance when working with large files.

The previously available Create a file module has been renamed Create a file (Legacy). While the legacy module is still available, we recommend using the new module.

For more information on Microsoft SharePoint Online modules, see [Microsoft SharePoint Online modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/sharepoint-modules.md).
