<!--

## Create custom JavaScript functions to use in scenarios

To provide better flexibility and control of your scenarios, we've added the ability to create a library of custom JavaScript functions that you can then use in scenarios. You can create custom functions in the Functions area of Fusion. You then add these functions to your scenarios in the form of an Adobe App Builder module.

Because custom functions work through Adobe App Builder, your organization must have an Adobe App Builder license to use them.

For more information on using custom functions in Fusion, see [Map data using custom functions](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/map-data/map-using-custom-functions.md).-->

## Update to incomplete execution guardrails

To better support large and complex scenarios, we've updated the guardrails for incomplete executions. Now, incomplete execution limits are per scenario. Fusion can store up to 1 GB or 100 incomplete executions per scenario, whichever limit is reached first. 

Previously, limits were based on teams.

FOr more information on guardrails in Fusion, see [Fusion performance guardrails](/help/workfront-fusion/references/scenarios/fusion-performance-guardrails.md).

## New Microsoft SharePoint Online > Create a file module

We're added a new Create a file module to the Microsoft SharePoint Online connector. The new module offers better performance when working with large files.

The previously available Create a file module has been renamed Create a file (Legacy). While the legacy module is still available, we recommend using the new module.

For more information on Microsoft SharePoint Online modules, see [Microsoft SharePoint Online modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/sharepoint-modules.md).
