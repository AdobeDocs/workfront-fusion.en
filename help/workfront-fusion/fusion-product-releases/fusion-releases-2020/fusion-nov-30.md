## Rate limit for Workfront Fusion 2.0 webhooks.

We've introduced a new performance guardrail for Workfront Fusion 2.0. Now, webhooks have a rate limit of 100 requests per second. When this limit is reached, Workfront Fusion 2.0 sends a 429 (Too Many Requests) status.

Previously, webhook requests were not limited.


## Add a custom form to a Workfront object in Workfront Fusion 2.0

To allow you to add custom forms to objects is Workfront Fusion 2.0, we've added a the AssignCategories action to the Workfront > Misc. Action module.

Previously, it was not possible to use a Workfront Fusion 2.0 module to add a custom form to an object in Workfront.
