## Go to debugging details from errored module

To make it easier to troubleshoot a module that has an error, you can now go directly to debugging details from that module. Clicking "Get details" in the module's output opens the debugger to the details of that error. 

For more information on the scenario debugger, see [Scenario Debugger](/help/workfront-fusion/manage-scenarios/debug-a-scenario.md#scenario-debugger) in the article Debug a scenario.
