## New experience when adding notes to a scenario

To make it easier to use notes in your scenarios, we've changed the way notes appear in the scenario editor. Now, when you click the Notes icon, you see the notes in boxes, with lines leading to the module that they are attached to. The notes can be dragged to different locations on the screen, allowing you to annotate your scenarios in the way that best helps you.

Previously, notes were listed on the right of the screen, not in the scenario editor itself.

For more information, see [Add notes to a scenario](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/config-scenarios-settings/add-notes-to-scenario.md),
