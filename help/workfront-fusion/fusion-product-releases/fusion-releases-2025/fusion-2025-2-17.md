## Look and feel updates for Adobe Workfront Fusion

To create a cleaner experience and align with Adobe style, we've updated the look and feel of some Fusion elements. These updates do not affect function, but allow for more consistency with the Adobe family of products.

As part of this change, we've added the current organization and team to the left navigation, making it easier for you to see which org and team's information you are viewing while you navigate to the different areas of Fusion.
