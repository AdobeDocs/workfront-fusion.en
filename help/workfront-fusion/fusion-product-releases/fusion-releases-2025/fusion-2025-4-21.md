## Download blueprints for previous scenario versions

To make it easier for you to use and compare scenario versions, we've made it easier to download the previous versions of a scenario. Now, you can download scenario versions from the scenario version viewer.

Previously you would need to restore a version to download its blueprint. 

For instructions on viewing and downloading previous versions of a scenario, see [View and manage scenario versions](/help/workfront-fusion/manage-scenarios/restore-a-scenario-version.md).
