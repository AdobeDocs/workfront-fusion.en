## Reorder routes by dragging and dropping

To make it easier to reorder routes in your Fusion scenarios, we've added the ability to reorder routes with a drag-and-drop interface. Now, you can control the execution order of your routes more easily by right-clicking the router module and selecting the option to order routes.

Previously, routes were disconnected and reconnected to the Router module to set the order in which they were executed.

For more information on routers, including how to reorder routes, see [Add a Router module and configure routes](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/add-modules/router-module.md).
