## File upload chunking available in SFTP > Upload a file module

We've added new field in the SFTP > Upload a File module to support file uploads using a chunking mechanism. Now, you can set the size in byles of each chunk when uploading files. This is useful for large files or when server memory limits requre smaller uploads.

This change does not affect existing scenarios, because the field is optional and only applied when explicitly set.

For more information on the SFTP > Upload a file module, see [SFTP modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/universal-connectors/sftp.md).
