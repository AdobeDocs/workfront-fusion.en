This page describes all enhancements made in Adobe Workfront Fusion the week of September 22, 2025.

For a list of recent bug fixes in Workfront Fusion, see the [Workfront Maintenance Updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-known-issues/releases/current-updates) page and check for any updates labeled Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update.

## Visual feedback enhancements when reordering routes

To make it easier to manage route order, we've added more visual feedback in the Order Routes window. Now, when you drag and drop routes, a green line indicates exactly where the route will appear in the list when you drop it. Other additional visual feedbacks makes it easier to track where a route is moving.

For information on using routes, including reordering them, see [Add a Router module and configure routes](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/add-modules/router-module.md).

## Visual enhancements to notes

To make notes easier to use, we've made some updates to the Notes icon. Now, opening notes does not affect the scenario view. In addition, a circle appears around the Notes icon when notes are open.

For more information on notes, see [Add notes to a scenario](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/config-scenarios-settings/add-notes-to-scenario.md).
