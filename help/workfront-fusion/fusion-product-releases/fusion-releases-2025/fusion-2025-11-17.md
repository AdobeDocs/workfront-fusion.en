New Slack connector now available

To expand the capabilities of the Slack connector and keep it current with updates made to the Slack application, we've created a new Slack connector. With the new connector, you can:

* Create, read, update or delete messages and files
* Create, join, leave, archive, unarchive, or retrieve information from channels
* Use pins, stars, reactions, and saved items
* Invite, list, retrieve, or kick users
* Create reminders and statuses
* Start a scenario based on new messages, users, events, or files
* Make a custom call to the Slack API

For information on the new Slack connector, see [Slack modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/slack-modules-new.md).
