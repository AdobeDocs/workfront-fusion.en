## New Slack connector now available

To expand the capabilities of the Slack connector and keep it current with updates made to the Slack application, we've created a new Slack connector. With the new connector, you can:

* Create, read, update or delete messages and files
* Create, join, leave, archive, unarchive, or retrieve information from channels
* Use pins, stars, reactions, and saved items
* Invite, list, retrieve, or kick users
* Create reminders and statuses
* Start a scenario based on new messages, users, events, or files
* Make a custom call to the Slack API

For information on the new Slack connector, see [Slack modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/slack-modules-new.md).

## Adobe Substance connector now available

To make it easier to use Adobe Substance with Fusion, we've created a dedicated Adobe Substance connector. With the Adobe Substance modules, you can:

* Create, render, or retrieve data about a 3D scene
* Convert 3D files
* Generate a composite
* Create a space

For information, see [Adobe Substance modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/adobe-substance-modules.md).

## Adobe Photoshop > Apply PSD Edits module now supports large files

To make it easier for you to edit large Photoshop files, the Adobe Photoshop > Apply PSD Edits module now supports large files.

Although there is no defined file size limit for the Workfront Fusion platform, scenario timeout or other factors may affect large file processing. 

For more information on large files, see [Working with large files](/help/workfront-fusion/references/scenarios/fusion-large-files.md).

For more information on Adobe Photoshop modules, see [Adobe Photoshop modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/adobe-photoshop-modules.md).
