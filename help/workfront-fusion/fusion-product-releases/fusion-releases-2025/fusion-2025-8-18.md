## New Jira connector and modules now available

To make connecting with Jira more flexible and simple, we've released a new connector for Jira. This connector can connect to both Jira Cloud or Jira Data Center, includes the following updgrades:

* The Watch for records modules can now watch worklogs and attachments, in addition to comments, issues, projects, and sprints.
* CRUD modules now include users, boards, categories, and filters, in addition to comments, issues, projects, sprints, worklogs, and attachments. (Users are available only in Create a record and Read a record.)
* The List and Search modules have been combined into a single module that supports issues, projects, users, sprints, boards, worklogs, comments, transition issues, and categories.
* OAuth 2 connections are now available.

The previously available Jira connectors (Jira Cloud and Jira server) are still available, but will not be supported moving foward.

For information and instructions on the new Jira connector, see [Jira modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/jira-modules-new.md).

## Use custom regular expressions in the Text parser

To make the Text parser more flexible, we've added the ability to add custom regular expressions. Now, in the Get elements from text module, you can select Custom in the Pattern field and then enter your custom regular expression.

Previously, regex patterns were limited to the list available in the Pattern field.

For information on the Text parser, including the Get elements from text module, see [Text parser](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/tools-and-transformers/text-parser.md).

## Create a link to a specific module in a scenario

To make debugging or sharing module configuration easier, we've made it possible to create a link to a specific module in a scenario.To create a link to a specific module, add `?moduleId=<module-id>` to the URL when viewing the following pages:

* Scenario edit page (URL ends in `/edit`)
* A specific scenarion execution (URL ends in `/logs/<log-id>`)

`<module-id>` refers to the number next to the module label when viewing the scenario.
