## Use custom regular expressions in the Text parser

To make the Text parser more flexible, we've added the ability to add custom regular expressions. Now, in the Get elements from text module, you can select Custom in the Pattern field and then enter your custom regular expression.

Previously, regex patterns were limited to the list available in the Pattern field.

For information on the Text parser, including the Get elements from text module, see [Text parser](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/tools-and-transformers/text-parser.md).
