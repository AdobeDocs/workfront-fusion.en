## Search an execution history for specific events or modules

To make it easier for you to find the information you are looking for in executions for large scenarios, we've added the ability to search the history for a specific execution. You can also narrow the search by event status, such as success, warnings, or errors. 

For more information, see [View a specific scenario execution](/help/workfront-fusion/manage-scenarios/view-a-specific-scenario-execution.md).
