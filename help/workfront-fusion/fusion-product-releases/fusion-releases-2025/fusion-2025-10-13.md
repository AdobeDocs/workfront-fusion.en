## Updated connection type for Figma

To ensure that Fusion conforms to Figma's updated security requirements, we've created a new Figma connection type. The connection type labeled as "Figma" without the legacy tag conforms with these updated requirements.

For information on Figma modules, including how to create a connection, see [Figma modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/figma-modules.md).
