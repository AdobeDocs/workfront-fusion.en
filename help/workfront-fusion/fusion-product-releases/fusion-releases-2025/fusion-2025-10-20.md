## New Workfront connector now available

To reflect changes made to the Workfront API, we've created a new version of the Workfront connector,

The new connector is labeled as "Workfront," and the previously available connector is labeled as "Workfront (Legacy)."  

The new connector also features the following new functionality:

* A new Get Presigned File URL module
* Server-to-server connections: Now, when creating a connection, you can create a server-to-server connection to connect to a project in the Adobe Developer Console.
* Simplified use of custom forms in modules: Now, you can select which custom form fields load when configuring the Create a record and Read a record modules. In addition, the Search module now loads all custom form fields by default.

We recommend:

* Using the new connector when creating or updating a scenario.
* Upgrading existing modules to the new connector. 

You can automatically upgrade your existing modules to the new connector.

* For instructions on upgrading existing modules, see [Upgrade a Workfront module to a new version](/help/workfront-fusion/manage-scenarios/update-module-to-new-version.md) in the article Upgrade a module to a new version.

* For information on why a new connector is sometimes necessary, see [Overview of APIs in Fusion](/help/workfront-fusion/get-started-with-fusion/understand-fusion/api-overview.md).To ensure that the Workfront Connector meets the evolving needs of its users, we've made some updates:

* For information on the Workfront connector, see [Workfront modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/workfront-modules.md).

## Webhook response time is now 5 minutes

Previously, the timeout for webhook responses was 40 seconds.
