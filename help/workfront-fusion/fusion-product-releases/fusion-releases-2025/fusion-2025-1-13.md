## Filter by record types and custom fields in Workfront Planning > Watch Events module

To make it easier for you to trigger scenarios from specific events in Workfront Planning, we've added more options to the event filters. Now, you can filter by record type, or by custom fields.

Previously, only native fields were available in the events filter.

For information and instructions, see [Watch Events](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/workfront-planning-modules.md#watch-events) in the article Workfront Planning Modules.
