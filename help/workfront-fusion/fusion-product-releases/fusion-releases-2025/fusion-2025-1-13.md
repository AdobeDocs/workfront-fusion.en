## Filter by record types and custom fields in Workfront Planning > Watch Events module

To make it easier for you to trigger scenarios from specific events in Workfront Planning, we've added more options to the event filters. Now, you can filter by record type, or by custom fields.

Previously, only native fields were available in the events filter.

For information and instructions, see [Watch Events](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/workfront-planning-modules.md#watch-events) in the article Workfront Planning Modules.

## Updates to data handling

We've made the following updates to data handling:

* The date parser now returns accurate dates for dates before 100 CE. 
* Database queries for the name field on documents now exclude documents where the name field contains undefined values or undefined array elements. It returns documents where the name field contains a null value, a null array element, or when the field does not exist. 

   Previously, queries would return documents in with undefined name values or elements.
