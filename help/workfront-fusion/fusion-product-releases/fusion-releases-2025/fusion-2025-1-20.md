## Update to Figma connection type

Figma has recently changed their authentication process. To meet the new authentication requirements, we've created a new connection type for Figma modules.

For new connections, use the Figma connection type.

The previous connection type now displays a "Legacy" label. We recommend updating your Figma modules to the new connection type as soon as possible.

For instructions, see [Create a connection to Figma](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/figma-modules.md#create-a-connection-to-figma) in the article Figma modules.
