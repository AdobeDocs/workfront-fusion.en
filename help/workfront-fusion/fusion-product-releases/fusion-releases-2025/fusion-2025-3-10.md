## Choose output data type in the Adobe Authenticator > Make an API call module

To make it easier for you to get your data in the format you need, we've added the ability to choose output data type in the Adobe Authenticator > Make an API call module. Now, you can select from the following output data types:

* JSON
* Raw
* Text
* String
* URL encoded
* Binary

If you do not select an output data type, the module detects a type.
