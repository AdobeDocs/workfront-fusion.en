## New variable available in mapping panel: `triggerTimestamp`

To make it easier to see when your scenario execution was triggered, we've added the variable `triggerTimestamp`. You can use this variable to define scenario logic based on the exact actual time that the scenario triggered.

This variable is found in the General section of the mapping panel.

For more information on the General mapping panel, see [General functions](/help/workfront-fusion/references/mapping-panel/functions/general-functions.md).
