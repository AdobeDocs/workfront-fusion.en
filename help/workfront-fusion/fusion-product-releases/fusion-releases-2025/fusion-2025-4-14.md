## New Frame.io version 4 connector available

To ensure that you can use the latest functionality in Frame.io, we've created a connector that is compatible with Frame.io version 4. 

The new connector is currently labeled as "Beta" in Fusion. The previous connector (version 3) is now labeled as "Legacy."

With the new connector, you can:

* Create assets, comments, folders, projects, share links, and workspaces
* Retrieve comments and assets, or list of comments, assets, projects, and workspaces
* Make custom calls to the Frame.io API
* And more

For information about the new Frame.io connector, see [Frame.io Beta connector](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/frame-io-modules-new.md).

## New variable available in mapping panel: `triggerTimestamp`

To make it easier to see when your scenario execution was triggered, we've added the variable `triggerTimestamp`. You can use this variable to define scenario logic based on the exact actual time that the scenario triggered.

This variable is found in the General section of the mapping panel.

For more information on the General mapping panel, see [General functions](/help/workfront-fusion/references/mapping-panel/functions/general-functions.md).
