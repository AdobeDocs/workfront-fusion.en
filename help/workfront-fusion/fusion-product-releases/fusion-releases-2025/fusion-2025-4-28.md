## Assign a scenario to a specific worker pool

To make it easier for org admins to dedicate resources to high priority scenarios, we've added the ability to assign a scenario to a specific worker pool. 

This setting is visible only if the following two conditions are met:

* You are an organization admin or owner
* More than one worker pool is associated with your organization.

For more information on scenario settings, see [Configure scenario settings](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/config-scenarios-settings/configure-scenario-settings.md).
