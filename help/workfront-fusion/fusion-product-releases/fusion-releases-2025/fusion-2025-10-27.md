## Enhanced Webhooks list now available

To make it easier for you to get the information you need, we've enhanced and expanded the Webhooks list. Now, you can:

* View and copy the webhook's URL
* See how many items are in a webhook's queue, and view the operations
* See which scenarios use a given webhook, and go to that sceanario directly from the Webhooks list
* See which connections are used in a given webhook, and go to that connection directly from the Webhooks list
* See whether a webhook is expired.

For more information on the new Webhooks list, see [View webhook details](/help/workfront-fusion/references/modules/webhooks-reference.md#view-webhook-details) in the article Instant triggers (webhooks).

## Credentials now available for authorization of custom webhooks

To make your webhooks more secure, we've added the ability to add credentials to your webhooks. By adding credentials to your webhooks, you can control who is authorized to used that webhook.

For information on configuring webhooks, including credentials, see [Webhooks](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/universal-connectors/webhooks-updated.md).
