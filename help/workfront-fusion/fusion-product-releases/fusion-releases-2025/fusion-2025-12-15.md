## Set webook priority

To make sure that your most important scenarios are handled first, we've added the ability to set priority for webhooks. Now, you can choose which webhooks have high, medium, or low priority. Webhooks with higher priority are handled first, which is useful when an organization's worker pool has many automations competing for resources.

For example, you could set high priority for production scenarios, and low priority for scenarios that are being tested.

For more information on webhooks, see [Instant triggers (webhooks)](/help/workfront-fusion/references/modules/webhooks-reference.md).

## Custom resources now available in Adobe Campaign modules

To make it easier for you to interact with resources in your Adobe Campaign modules, we've added custom resources to the list of resources in the following modules:

* Create a record
* Delete a record
* Perform an action
* Read a record
* Update a record
* Search
