## Use certificate authorization when connecting to Microsoft SharePoint

We've created a new connection type for the Microsoft SharePoint connector. Now, you can connect using Microsoft Entra certificate-based authorization.

For instructions on configuring certificate authorization in the  Microsoft SharePoint connector, see [Connect Microsoft SharePoint Online to [!DNL Workfront Fusion] using certificate authorization](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/sharepoint-modules.md#connect-microsoft-sharepoint-online-to-workfront-fusion-using-certificate-authorization) in the article Microsoft SharePoint modules.

## New connection type available in Azure DevOps connector

To make it easier to request all scopes when configuring a connection in Azure DevOps, we've created a new type of connection. The Azure DevOps EntraApp connection type includes a toggle that allows you to request all scopes for the connection.

For instructions on configuring certificate authorization in the  Azure DevOps connector, see [Connect [!DNL Azure DevOps] to [!DNL Workfront Fusion]](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/third-party-connectors/azure-dev-ops.md#connect-azure-devops-to-workfront-fusion) in the article Azure DevOps modules.
