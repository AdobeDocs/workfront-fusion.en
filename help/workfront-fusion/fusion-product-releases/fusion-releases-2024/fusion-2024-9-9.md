## Workfront Planning > Search module now outputs results in bundles

To make the Workfront Planning connector easier to use, we've modified the Search module to output bundles. This allows you to more easily perform actions on the results of the search.

Previously, the Search module output a collection of results.

Pre-existing Search modules will continue to output a collection. If you want your Search modules to output bundles, you must remove the existing Search module and replace it with the new one.

For more information on Workfront Planning modules, see [Workfront Planning modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/workfront-planning-modules.md).
