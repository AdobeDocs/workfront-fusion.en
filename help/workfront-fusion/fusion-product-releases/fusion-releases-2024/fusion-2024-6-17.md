## Adobe I/O Events connector and modules now available

To allow you to integrate with Adobe I/O Events, we've created a new connector. With the Adobe Adobe I/O Events modules, you can:

* Create an event registration
* List  all events in a journal
* Get provider or event IDs
* Make a custom API call to the Adobe Journey Optimizer API

For information about the Adobe Journey Optimizer connector, see [[!DNL Adobe I/O Events] modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/adobe-io-events-modules.md).

## Generate multiple images in the Adobe Firefly connector

Generating multiple images allows you to select the one that most closely matches what you are looking for. Now, Adobe Firefly modules can generate up to four images per module execution.

Previously, modules could only generate a single image per execution.

For information on the Adobe Firefly connector, see [Adobe Firefly modules](/help/workfront-fusion/references/apps-and-modules/adobe-connectors/adobe-firefly-modules.md).
