# Navigate Adobe Workfront Fusion

You can navigate through the different areas of Adobe Workfront Fusion by using the left navigation panel. Here, you can find all of the major areas of Fusion, and can quickly move from one area to another.

This article introduces these areas, and provides links to more information about each area.

| Area | Description | For more information, see |
|---|---|---|
| Org overview <br> ![Org icon](assets/org-icon.png) | Here, you can see information about your Fusion organization. You can view the number of operations performed by scenarios in this organization, as well as a list of active scenarios. You can also view lists of this organization's team, users, and environments.<br>The currently selected organization displays above this icon.| [Organizations and teams](/help/workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-orgs-and-teams/set-up-orgs-teams-and-users/org-and-team-overview.md) |
| Team overview  <br> ![Team icon](assets/team-icon.png) | Here, you can see information about Fusion teams, such as the number of operations performed by scenarios in this team and a list of active scenarios. You can also view and manage the users on this team. When viewing a team, you can select a different team from a dropdown at the top of this page.<br>The currently selected team displays above this icon.<br>You may need to create a team before you can see the team overview or any of the team sections listed in this article. | [Organiztions and teams](/help/workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-workfront-fusion/set-up-and-manage-orgs-and-teams/set-up-orgs-teams-and-users/org-and-team-overview.md)| 
| Scenarios  <br> ![Scenarios icon](assets/scenarios-icon.png) | A scenario in Fusion represents an automated workflow. For example, one scenario may watch for incoming Workfront requests and convert them to projects, while another scenario may generate images, upload them to a document provider, and add approval tasks to Workfront. Most of your work in Fusion is configuring and managing scenarios. In the Scenarios area, you can view and organize a list of your team's scenarios, select individual scenarios to view or modify, or begin creating a new scenario. | [Scenario overview](/help/workfront-fusion/get-started-with-fusion/understand-fusion/scenario-overview.md) |
| Templates  <br> ![Templates icon](assets/templates-icon.png) | Templates are prebuilt scenarios that you can configure for your own use cases. Here, you can see public scenarios provided by Workfront Fusion, as well as templates created by your team. | [Create and manage templates: article index](/help/workfront-fusion/create-and-manage-templates/create-manage-templates-toc.md) |
| Connections  <br> ![Connections icon](assets/connections-icon.png)| Connections contain login credentials and permissions that allow Fusion to interact with other applications. You create a connection with a specific set of credentials and permissions for a specific application, and then use that connection in your scenario. The scenario can then access and modify the records or other data available to a user with those credentials and permissions. You can create multiple connections for an application, and can use a connection in multiple scenarios. In the Connections area, you can view and manage a list of connections that have been set up by your team.| [Connection overview](/help/workfront-fusion/get-started-with-fusion/understand-fusion/connection-overview.md) | 
| Webhooks <br> ![Webhooks icon](assets/webhooks-icon.png) | Webhooks watch applications for changes, and then start a scenario based on that change. For example, you can configure a webhook to start a scenario when an issue is submitted to a particular Workfront project. In the Webhooks area, you can see a list of webhooks configured by your team, and the scenarios they are used in.| [Instant triggers (webhooks)](/help/workfront-fusion/references/modules/webhooks-reference.md) |
| Keys <br> ![Keys icon](assets/keys-icon.png) | Public and private keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key can be distributed, and anyone with the public key can encrypt data, but only the private key can decrypt it. Similarly, a user with a private key can encrypt data that anyone with the public key can decrypt. In the Keys area, you can view and manage keys that your team owns. | [Keys](/help/workfront-fusion/references/modules/keys.md) |
| Data Stores  <br> ![Data stores icon](assets/data-store-icon.png) | Data stores are small databases that exist outside of scenarios. Data stores allow you to transfer data between scenarios or between separate runs of a scenario. In the Data Stores area, you can view and manage data stores owned by your team. | [Data Stores](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/map-data/data-stores.md) | 
| Data Structures <br> ![Data structures icon](assets/data-structure-icon.png) | Data structures describe the format of data being transferred to Fusion, and are commonly used for serializing or parsing formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV. In the Data Structures, you can view and manage data structures owned by your team. | [Data structures](/help/workfront-fusion/references/mapping-panel/data-types/data-structures.md) |
