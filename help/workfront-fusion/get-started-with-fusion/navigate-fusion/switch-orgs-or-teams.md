## Switch between organizations

You may be part of more than one organization in Fusion. Resources are not shared between organizations.

You can switch organizations within the Adobe Unified Experience by clicking the organization name in the upper-right corner and selecting the new organization from the dropdown. Only organizations that have a Fusion account will appear in the dropdown, even if you are a member of other organizations in Adobe.

## Switch between teams

You may be part of more than one team in Fusion. Since teams do not share resources, you may need to switch teams to access specific scenarios or other resources.

To switch between teams, select a new team by clicking on the team name in the header, then selecting a team from the dropdown. 

This option is available on all pages reached by clicking an item in the left navigation (with the exception of Org overview), such as the Scenarios page or the Connections page.
