# View data flow in a running scenario

You can watch a running scenario to see how data flows through it. 

While a scenario runs, the active module is marked by a growing ring around the module. The ring shows only that the module is running, not its progress. Modules that run quickly may only display a small part of the ring.

After the module has run, an output indicator appears.

If the module processes more than one bumdle, the ring appears for each processed bundle, and the output indicator counts up for each bundle it outputs.

Fore more information on scenario data flow, see [Scenario execution flow](/help/workfront-fusion/references/scenarios/scenario-execution-flow.md).
