# Activate or deactivate a scenario

You can work with scenarios either in an active or an inactive state:

* An active scenario executes periodically according to its defined schedule, as explained in [Schedule a scenario](/help/workfront-fusion/create-scenarios/config-scenarios-settings/schedule-a-scenario.md).

   This is useful when you want to automate the function of a scenario.

* An inactive scenario executes only when you run it manually.

   This is useful when you want to run the scenario manually every time.

You can activate or deactivate a scenario at any time, depending on how you want to use the scenario.

A newly created scenario is inactive by default.
